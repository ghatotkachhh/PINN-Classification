# PINN-Classification

This repository contains the solution to the evaluation test of the GSoC: ML4Sci Project named Deeplense. The project aims to explore deep learning techniques for gravitational lensing analysis.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find two main notebooks:

1. **multiclassclassification.ipynb**: This notebook contains the training process for the common task, which involves multi-class classification of strong lensing images into three categories: images with no substructure, subhalo substructure, and vortex substructure.

2. **PINN-gravitationallensingeq.ipynb**: This notebook is dedicated to the specific task 5, where we implement a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) architecture. The goal is to utilize the gravitational lensing equation within the architecture to enhance the network's performance compared to the results obtained in the common task.
